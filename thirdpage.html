            <h2>6. Mary Keller</h2>
            <p>
                Mary Keller was born in 1913 and died in 1985 and was an American roman catholic religious sister. In 1958 she started at the National Science Foundation workshop in the computer science department at Dartmouth College which at the time was an all-male school. She teamed up with 2 other scientists to develop the BASIC computer programming language. In 1965 Mary earned her PH. D in computer science from the University of Michigan. She went on to develop a computer science department in a catholic college for women called Clarke College. For 20 years she chaired the department where she was an advocate for women in computer science and supported working mothers by encouraging them to bring their babies to class with them. She is known as one of the famous women in technology for being the first woman to receive a PH. D in computer science and Clarke University (Clarke College) have established the Mary Keller Computer Science Scholarship in her honour.

            <h2>7. Radia Perlman</h2>
            <p>
                Radia was born in 1951 in New Jersey and attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and learned programming for a physics class. She received a B.S and M.S in mathematics and a PH. D in Computer science from MIT in 1988. In the 1970s Radia developed a child-friendly education language call TORTIS. The programming language was installed into a turtle and research was conducted on young children. In the 1980s Radia invented the spanning tree algorithm and the spinning tree protocol. The spinning tree algorithm transformed ethernet from a single wire CSMA into a protocol that could handle large clouds. Radia is known as the ‘mother of the internet’ and for creating STP which is fundamental for the operation of network bridges.

            <h2>8. Katherine Johnson</h2>
            <p>
                Katherine Johnson was born in 1918 in West Virginia and was one of 3 black students to attended West Virginias graduate college. In 1937 she received a B.S in Mathematics and French from the State School. After getting married and having a family, a relative told her about open positions at the all-black computing section at the National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics (NACA) laboratory. The launch of the Soviet satellite sputnik change history along with Kathrine Johnson’s life as she was the one who manually run the same equations through her desktop that the machine used to ensure that they were safe to go before take-off. This was a very big responsibility for Kathrine as the astronaut’s lives were in her hands and were not taking off until they received the signal from her. The flight was a success and marked a turning point in the competition between the US and the Soviet Union in space. Kathrine is well known for this event and is one of the famous women in technology for co-authoring 26 research reports that provide mathematic equations for machines.

            <h2>9. Karen Sparck Jones</h2>
            <p>
                Karen Jones was born in 1935 and died in 2007, she studied history and philosophy at Grinton college in Cambridgeshire from 1953 to 1956. In the 1960s she started to work on information retrieval (IR) and introduced the IDF term weighting which has been adopted by modern systems such as web search engines. She was a major figure in setting standards for a large proportion of the work in natural language processing (NPL) in the US and other countries. She taught many PhD students in computer speech and language the diverse areas of NPL and IR. She is well known for working on the IR and introducing the IDF term to produce natural language for the search engines that we use daily.

            <h2>10. Elizabeth Feinler</h2>
            <p>
                Elizabeth was born in 1931 in West Virginia and was the first person in her family to attend University and receive an undergraduate degree from the West Liberty State College. Whilst working towards her PhD in biochemistry she discovered her love for data compilations when working at her part-time job. She decided not to carry on her PhD and from 1972-1989 she was a director of the network information systems centre at the Stanford research institute. The institute oversaw internet addresses and if you wanted a domain, you would have to go to Elizabeth. The network information centre was like the prehistoric google and by the late 1980s, the community had moved to the domain name system which helped lay the foundation for the modern internet. Elizabeth is well known for being one of the famous women in technology for helping the Stanford research institute transition to the domain name system and introducing the domain name protocol, she’s the one to thank for the dot coms, dot nets and dot govs used daily.
